# Enhanced NexHealth Integration

This document provides an overview of the enhanced NexHealth integration in the DentalHub application.

## Overview

The enhanced NexHealth integration allows DentalHub to pull in all available data from the NexHealth API, store it in the database, and display it in the patient record page. It also includes a continuous sync mechanism to keep the data up-to-date.

## Features

### 1. Comprehensive Data Sync

The enhanced integration pulls in all available data from NexHealth, including:

- Patient demographic information
- Contact details
- Address information
- Insurance coverage
- Appointments
- Documents
- Financial information

### 2. Continuous Sync

The integration includes a continuous sync mechanism that uses webhooks to keep the data up-to-date. When a change is made in NexHealth, a webhook is triggered that updates the corresponding data in DentalHub.

### 3. Batch Processing

For large datasets, the integration uses batch processing to efficiently sync data. This includes:

- Parallel processing of batches
- Throttling to avoid overwhelming the NexHealth API
- Retry logic for failed requests
- Progress tracking and reporting

### 4. Error Handling and Logging

The integration includes comprehensive error handling and logging, including:

- Structured logging with context information
- Different log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Audit trail for all webhook events
- Detailed error messages for troubleshooting

### 5. Security

The integration includes security features to protect sensitive data, including:

- Webhook signature verification
- IP validation for webhook requests
- Rate limiting for webhook endpoints
- Audit logging for all webhook events

## Components

### 1. NexHealthSyncService

The `NexHealthSyncService` is the main service responsible for syncing data between NexHealth and DentalHub. It includes methods for:

- Starting a full sync of all patient data
- Syncing a single patient's data
- Syncing related data (appointments, documents, insurance)
- Setting up continuous sync using webhooks
- Handling webhook events

### 2. NexHealthAdapter

The `NexHealthAdapter` is responsible for making requests to the NexHealth API. It handles:

- Authentication with NexHealth
- Making API requests
- Handling API responses
- Error handling

### 3. NexHealthLogger

The `NexHealthLogger` is a specialized logger for NexHealth integration that provides structured logging with context information and different log levels.

### 4. NexHealthBatchProcessor

The `NexHealthBatchProcessor` is responsible for efficiently processing large datasets in batches. It includes:

- Batch processing with configurable batch size
- Parallel processing with configurable concurrency
- Retry logic for failed batches
- Progress tracking and reporting

### 5. NexHealthWebhookValidator

The `NexHealthWebhookValidator` is responsible for validating incoming webhook requests from NexHealth to ensure they are authentic and have not been tampered with.

## Database Schema

The integration uses the following database tables:

- `nexhealth_patients`: Stores patient data from NexHealth
- `nexhealth_appointments`: Stores appointment data from NexHealth
- `nexhealth_documents`: Stores document metadata from NexHealth
- `nexhealth_insurance_coverages`: Stores insurance coverage data from NexHealth
- `nexhealth_sync_logs`: Stores logs of sync operations
- `nexhealth_webhooks`: Stores webhook configuration
- `nexhealth_webhook_events`: Stores webhook events for audit and debugging purposes

## Testing

The integration includes comprehensive testing utilities:

- `NexHealthTester`: A utility for testing the NexHealth integration
- Test scripts for testing different aspects of the integration
- Dry-run capability for testing sync without saving

## Usage

### Starting a Full Sync

```typescript
const syncService = new NexHealthSyncService('default');
const syncLog = await syncService.startFullSync(
  (progress, total) => {
    console.log(`Progress: ${progress}/${total}`);
  },
  {
    batchSize: 50,
    maxConcurrent: 2,
    testMode: false
  }
);
```

### Setting Up Continuous Sync

```typescript
const syncService = new NexHealthSyncService('default');
await syncService.setupContinuousSync('https://example.com/api/nexhealth-webhook');
```

### Handling Webhook Events

The webhook endpoint is automatically set up at `/api/nexhealth-webhook`. When a webhook event is received, it is processed by the `NexHealthSyncService.handleWebhookEvent` method.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failures**: Check that the NexHealth API key is correct and has the necessary permissions.

2. **Webhook Setup Failures**: Check that the webhook URL is publicly accessible and that the NexHealth account has webhook permissions.

3. **Sync Failures**: Check the sync logs in the `nexhealth_sync_logs` table for details on what went wrong.

4. **Webhook Processing Failures**: Check the webhook events in the `nexhealth_webhook_events` table for details on what went wrong.

### Logging

The integration uses structured logging with different log levels. You can configure the log level in the `NexHealthLogger` to get more or less detailed logs.

### Monitoring

The integration includes monitoring capabilities:

- Sync logs in the `nexhealth_sync_logs` table
- Webhook events in the `nexhealth_webhook_events` table
- Structured logs with context information

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Updates**: Implement real-time updates using WebSockets to notify users when data changes.

2. **Advanced Filtering**: Implement advanced filtering options for syncing specific subsets of data.

3. **Data Validation**: Implement more comprehensive data validation to ensure data integrity.

4. **Performance Optimization**: Further optimize the sync process for very large datasets.

5. **Multi-tenant Support**: Enhance multi-tenant support for practices with multiple locations.

## Conclusion

The enhanced NexHealth integration provides a robust, secure, and efficient way to sync data between NexHealth and DentalHub. It includes comprehensive error handling, logging, and monitoring capabilities to ensure reliable operation.
